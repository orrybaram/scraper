The conjured creature acts on the same initiative count as you.

A conjured creature has hit points, defenses, and attacks as indicated in its statistics block. It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you’ve taken an extended rest. Conjured creatures lack basic attacks and therefore cannot make opportunity attacks.

Many at first believed the inclusion of the frog to be an affectation of the artist—Khyaran relied on the great talent of Ruobald Kent, whose talent with the brush exceeded all his contemporaries. Later, most rejected the theory because the frog never appeared in any of Kent’s other works. The frog then remained a mystery until an adventuring group located the Profound’s tomb and recovered the frog, learning of its unusual magical properties.               Since the emerald frog’s rediscovery, many artificers and alchemists have sought to reproduce its curious magic to create new figurines modeled after the first. These copies are worthwhile, but none of them come close to matching the original’s power. Some say the frog, despite its modest size, could swallow a dragon whole, though the methods by which it achieved this are thus far beyond any artisan’s understanding.",

The creature obeys only you, responding to commands spoken in any language. The creature remains for up to 8 hours or until you use a minor action to dismiss it. The conjured creature acts on the same initiative count as you. Every action it takes costs you a minor action (which you use to issue commands), and a conjured creature cannot exceed its normal allotment of actions (a standard, a move, and a minor action) during its turn. If you spend no minor actions on your turn to command the creature, it remains where it is without taking any actions on its turn.          A conjured creature has hit points, defenses, and attacks as indicated in its statistics block. It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you’ve taken an extended rest. Conjured creatures lack basic attacks and therefore cannot make opportunity attacks.          Mount: If the conjured creature has the mount keyword, you can ride the creature and are considered to have the Mounted Combat feat while mounted on it. While mounted, you can command the creature using free actions, though the mount is still limited to its normal allotment of actions. You can choose to be mounted on the creature when it appears.",

The creature obeys only you, responding to commands spoken in any language. The creature remains for up to 8 hours or until you use a minor action to dismiss it. The conjured creature acts on the same initiative count as you. Every action it takes costs you a minor action (which you use to issue commands), and a conjured creature cannot exceed its normal allotment of actions (a standard, a move, and a minor action) during its turn. If you spend no minor actions on your turn to command the creature, it remains where it is without taking any actions on its turn.          A conjured creature has hit points, defenses, and attacks as indicated in its statistics block. It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you’ve taken an extended rest. Conjured creatures lack basic attacks and therefore cannot make opportunity attacks.          Mount: If the conjured creature has the mount keyword, you can ride the creature and are considered to have the Mounted Combat feat while mounted on it. While mounted, you can command the creature using free actions, though the mount is still limited to its normal allotment of actions. You can choose to be mounted on the creature when it appears.",

For all the dangers it poses, adventurers still mount expeditions into the wastes in hopes of recovering the fabulous treasures believed to be housed in lost ruins and decimated cities. Few adventurers recover items, but the rare magic discovered is enough to draw new explorers from all over the world.               The mercury wasps were uncovered from the fabled Forgotten City. Mages deemed the items to be figurines of wondrous power since they shared the same properties as other items, but they had one distinctive quality. Rather than conjure a single creature, the figurine summoned a swarm of thumb-size black wasps that seethed and hummed with unexpected fury. Many believe these wasps speak to the character of the lost peoples destroyed long ago.",

        "description": ": When you activate a figurine, the conjured creature appears in a space adjacent to you, provided the space is large enough to contain the creature without squeezing. The creature obeys only you, responding to commands spoken in any language. The creature remains for up to 8 hours or until you use a minor action to dismiss it. The conjured creature acts on the same initiative count as you. Every action it takes costs you a minor action (which you use to issue commands), and a conjured creature cannot exceed its normal allotment of actions (a standard, a move, and a minor action) during its turn. If you spend no minor actions on your turn to command the creature, it remains where it is without taking any actions on its turn.          A conjured creature has hit points, defenses, and attacks as indicated in its statistics block. It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you’ve taken an extended rest. Conjured creatures lack basic attacks and therefore cannot make opportunity attacks.          Mount: If the conjured creature has the mount keyword, you can ride the creature and are considered to have the Mounted Combat feat while mounted on it. While mounted, you can command the creature using free actions, though the mount is still limited to its normal allotment of actions. You can choose to be mounted on the creature when it appears.",

One of these feathers is by no means infallible. There is no way to inspect the feather to ensure that it is linked to a specific person.

One of these masks attaches tightly to the face of any creature that dons it, allowing the wearer to perfectly adopt the features of the creature that the mask depicts. A creature wearing a doppelganger mask gains a +5 bonus to Bluff checks to disguise itself as the kind of creature the mask depicts, as long as the wearer’s body generally resembles that of such a creature.        A doppelganger mask tears apart when removed from the face, so each can be used only once. Spies and members of the Unseelie underworld often use them, and some masks make their way to criminal organizations in the natural world."

Once a route has been started, the stones in a bag can be used only for that route, and the rest of them must be laid continually. The path can be up to 5 miles long, provided the creature blazing the trail walks the entire distance, dropping the rest of the stones from time to time along the way. The path lasts for a day before it disappears; the area it described returns to the state it was in before the stones were used, and the stones become like any other ordinary rocks scattered in the wilderness.        Scouts in the wild use false path stones to create simple roads that make travel easier for those following behind them."

The garment looks and feels like a normal wool cloak, except that it keeps its wearer completely dry in the rain. When the cloak is spread out on the ground, it becomes a puddle of pure rainwater. You can turn the pool back into a cloak again by grabbing the water (a minor action), or water can be taken from the pool using a cup or a similar vessel. Doing so gradually uses up the cloak’s material, making it shorter every time it reverts to a garment, until nothing is left of it after 2 gallons of its water are consumed."

Some wild fey add a shapechanger’s eyelash to the mixture, causing their hair to change color every seventh heartbeat.        A single dose of one of these mixtures, collectively called the hair of fairy hues, can instantly alter the hair color of any individual. The new color lasts until the hair is washed in a still pond beneath the light of the moon, or until the hair grows out."

After a treatment of snake oil, the treated skin peels away from the body, leaving behind soft, smooth flesh. Full-body treatments of snake oil have been known to reverse the cosmetic effects of the aging process, removing an entire year of wear from the body with each treatment. The cost of doing so is a reasonable option only for the wealthy. Even though the treatment removes the physical effects of aging on the skin, as well as some of the associated aches and pains, all other bodily processes continue to age normally. Death cannot be put off by using snake oil, a fact seldom conveyed by those who sell it."

While a creature sleeps, the net is placed over it, and the creature’s dreams are absorbed into the net’s filaments. When the creature awakens, the net can be boiled in a cauldron or other large vessel. The trapped dreams evaporate into steam that rises in wispy shapes, playing out the events of the dream for any to view.        Instead of boiling a net that has captured one creature’s dreams in this manner, the user of the net can cut it into small sections and consume a portion to experience the captured dreams directly, allowing the viewer to experience the same set of dreams over time. A dream experienced in this way is more intense and offers deeper insights about the dreamer. A dream that arises from a portion of a net being  consumed cannot be captured by another dream net."

In the twilight just after sunset, its flowers glow slightly. At midnight, gazing down on a field of star-indigo plants is like looking at the night sky in reverse, as its flowers shine  as brightly as the stars. Feywild creatures often arrange star-indigo seeds in symbols and messages that can be seen only in the dark of night. Dyes made from star-indigo plants pass their nocturnal glowing quality to clothing and ink, and an object colored with these dyes emits light equivalent to  that of a candle."

The conjured creature acts on the same initiative count as you. Every action it takes costs you a minor action (which you use to issue commands), and a conjured creature cannot exceed its normal allotment of actions (a standard, a move, and a minor action) during its turn. If you spend no minor actions on your turn to command the creature, it remains where it is without taking any actions on its turn.          A conjured creature has hit points, defenses, and attacks as indicated in its statistics block. It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you’ve taken an extended rest. Conjured creatures lack basic attacks and therefore cannot make opportunity attacks.          Mount: If the conjured creature has the mount keyword, you can ride the creature and are considered to have the Mounted Combat feat while mounted on it. While mounted, you can command the creature using free actions, though the mount is still limited to its normal allotment of actions. You can choose to be mounted on the creature when it appears.",
